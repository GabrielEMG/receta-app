This aplication was made as vanilla React-native as possible.
There are 2 modules that were necesary to create the app, which are:

  - react-navigation
  - async-storage


Instead of using Redux, I used the build-in React.useContext function to manage global states like the favorite recipe array.

### To run the app

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/GabrielEMG/receta-app
$ cd receta-app
$ yarn install
$ expo start

"A panel should pop-up in your browser.
 After this you can open the app via web, emulator or expo"

```
